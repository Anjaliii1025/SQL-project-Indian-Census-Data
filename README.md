# SQL-project-Indian-Census-Data
Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the Indian Census dataset using SQL. The dataset contains valuable demographic data that can be leveraged to understand India's population trends, literacy rates, gender distribution, and more. In this project, I applied SQL techniques to clean, process, and analyze large datasets, extracting meaningful insights from them.

Project Objectives:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Indian Census dataset.

Apply SQL queries to clean, aggregate, and filter the data.

Extract key insights related to population statistics, literacy, gender ratios, and urban vs rural distribution.

Generate reports and insights that can aid in understanding demographic trends in India.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Preprocessed raw data to remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.

Advanced SQL Queries: Used JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and WHERE clauses to filter, aggregate, and analyze data.

Demographic Insights: Analyzed factors such as gender distribution, literacy rates, urbanization, and population growth across different states and regions.

Reporting: Generated comprehensive SQL queries to report on trends and compare various demographic indicators.


Skills & Technologies Used:

SQL: Advanced queries, aggregations, joins, subqueries, and data manipulation.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, normalization, and preprocessing techniques.

Data Analysis: Extracting trends and insights from large datasets.

Tools: MySQL


Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is from the Indian Census Data. The data includes variables such as:
Total population
Literacy rates
Areas
State-wise and district-wise demographic breakdown
